Description: The Odin Project : Foundations : Calculator Project v2

---
# Overview:
This project is a part of [The Odin Project: Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course. For this project we were supposed to create 
a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Calculator Functionality:
* Addition 
* Subtractaction
* Multiplication
* Division

*Note: I didn't finish adding the functionality for the modulus operator, and the button to make positive numbers negative and negative numbers positive.*

## Project Overview

**Calculator Reference:** For the GUI and functionality of the calculator, I am using the Calculator App on iPhone as a reference.

### Previous Project Version
For my previous version of this project was coding the calculator's functionality inside of one JavaScript file.
This started to cause issues for me because:
* The file was starting to get big and hard to keep track of everything
* I started to notice that some of my code was being placed inside of other pieces of code which it probably shouldn't
* I ran into issues with debugging the issues due to the code interacting with other pieces of code, and tracking the root cause

### New Project Version *(This current version)*
Due to the issues I ran into with the 1st version of this project as mentioned above, 
I decided to incorporate Object-Oriented Programming Principles (OOP) and separate the related code into different classes.

Even though I am familiar with OOP with programming languages such as Java and C#, at this moment of working on this project I wasn't
familiar with them in JavaScript. 

I had to learn the following for JavaScript:
* How to create a class
* How to create a constructor
* How to create Getter & Setter methods
* How to separate files and import files to another file
* How to create documentation comments similar to JavaDocs - *Note: I just wanted to learn how to do this to better document my code*

### Learnings

This project taught me a lot and was a great exercise because I was re-creating the functionality of a piece of software that was already created.
So, I was able to reference the calculator app on my iPhone while working on this project, and test out different input combinations to see
how the app handled certain situations; then replicate it with this project.
